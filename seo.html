            <p>Dear John,
            </p>
            <p>I am a Belgian computer science student. I study “New Media & Communication Technology” at Howest in
                Kortrijk, Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>It’s my last year and for my thesis, I have to do research on semantic html 5 tags.
                I have done a lot of research and your name keeps popping up on Twitter and the Google forums.
                Throughout the years, the answers were sometimes very different.
            </p>
            <p>I was hoping you could provide me your insights on the matter?
            </p>
            <p>My main question is: “Is it useful (anno 2018) to shape the web with various semantic tags?”
                This is a very broad question, so I divided the question into a series of sub-questions.
                My most important questions for you are “How important is the general use of HTML5 tags?” and “Is their
                any impact on SEO?”
            </p>
            <p>It would also be interesting to hear your opinion and expertise on the other questions: <br>
                - Is this still relevant in web 3.0? <br>
                - Is their any impact on screen readers?
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for considering my request.
            </p>
            <p>Kind regards, <br>
                Gaëtan Van Den Berge

            <p>Hi! Happy to help :)
            </p>
            <p>I think this topic is often conflated with other items, which makes it hard. In particular, <strong>at Google we
                don't do anything special with the newer HTML5 tags.You can make up tags of your own, and they'll be
                +/-
                valid HTML, which is somewhat how we treat these "new" tags </strong> (they've been around for a long time, but
                anyway). Usually the process for changes in our systems in search is roughly: "we recognize that the
                web is
                doing something in a particular way, which is also beneficial for us" -> "we'll analyze advantages from
                using them" -> if there are significant advantages, we start using them. We wouldn't just change our
                systems based on how something could be used in theory, there has to be a real advantage to the end
                result
                (search quality) in order for us to add any complexity to our algorithms. That's still not
                the
                case with HTML5 -- we can recognize content on a page the same regardless of HTML5 usage or not.
            </p>
            <p>The things this gets conflated with are creating a semantic structure on your page, or using valid HTML.
                Both of these do help us to better understand the content on a page, but it's not a matter of ranking
                higher just because they do this. For example, I can't read Polish, but I can read the letters on a web
                page in Polish, I can pull out the words, so I could point to that page if someone were to ask me for
                those
                words. However, if I could also read Polish, or if that page were in English, then <strong>I could better
                understand for which queries I might point at that page.</strong> Similarly, we can process all forms of broken
                HTML
                (the web is broken all over), and we can rank those pages in various ways, but it's easier if we have a
                clearer <strong>context</strong>. This is even more relevant nowadays with structured data on pages, where we need to
                understand which concepts on a page the structured data applies to.
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, I think that's why you see such a variety of answers on this topic. <strong>Google doesn't use HTML5, we
                don't require semantic or valid HTML, its existence isn't a ranking factor, but it can make it easier
                to
                recognize the content, and show it for the relevant search results. </strong> (The trick is that "relevant search
                results" might be fewer than otherwise, but they're the ones that are useful for your pages. If you get
                1000 people coming to your page and they laugh at a joke you have on there then leave, is it as
                valuable as
                getting just 10 people, if those 10 also buy something from there?
